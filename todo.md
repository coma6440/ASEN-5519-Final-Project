## TODO
- Adjust goal in .yaml files to be the true goal
- Move plotting to MATLAB due to z-ordering issue in python. Can use convhull in MATLAB
- Add goal regions to plots
- Write psuedocode for informed SST
- Implement kinodynamic benchmarking. See https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/benchmark.html
- Can try restricting state space on the planner level in main.cpp
- Define final environments to use for planning. Can try creating maze like structure. Use simple block and w6
- Collect geometric results
- Define new naming scheme for solutions and figures
- Start overleaf document
- Collect results for current optimization objective
- Try different optimization objective? Time would be a good one to use since the robot can rotate when stopped.
- Add check for only updating path if future expected cost is better than current cost
