## TODO
- <s>Adjust goal in .yaml files to be the true goal</s>
- Move plotting to MATLAB due to z-ordering issue in python. Can use convhull in MATLAB
- <s>Add goal regions to plots</s>
- Write psuedocode for informed SST
- Figure out why kinodynamic is moving through obstacles and implement a fix.
- <s> Implement kinodynamic benchmarking. See https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/benchmark.html </s>
- Can try restricting state space on the planner level in main.cpp
- <s> Define final environments to use for planning. Can try creating maze like structure. Use simple block and w6 </s>
- <s> Collect geometric results, used RRTconnect </s>
- Start overleaf document
- Collect results for current optimization objective
- Try different optimization objective? Time would be a good one to use since the robot can rotate when stopped.
- Add check for only updating path if future expected cost is better than current cost
